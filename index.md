# Unity computer game
My project is to make a 2D video game with Unity. You can use your keyboard to control the character to move.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to learn some basic things about Unity and add some basic elements to my game. After installing Unity and creating a new project, I dragged the sprites folder into the project which can be downloaded from the instruction I read. The great thing is Unity already had a gravity system, so I just add colliders(also called the hitbox) to all the elements. The instruction also provide some animations, so when I edited the animator interface and started the game, the whole game looked animate.
