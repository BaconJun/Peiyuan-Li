# Unity computer game
My project is to make a 2D video game with Unity. You can use your keyboard to control the character to move.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone was to complete the entire game. The gameplay of this game is to use the keyboard to control the character to move to the right, you can see the upper left corner of the score, to achieve a high score is the goal of the game. Of course, the game will not allow you to simply score points, the game will randomly generate a variety of ICONS, obstacles, bombs, you need to avoid obstacles and bombs, eat ICONS, go farther, so as to get higher scores.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone was to control the graphics throughout the game to make it look more like a mini-game. I added a pen that would draw as we moved to the right to create a floor that the character could move on. At the same time, the whole game will move. At the same time, I added more animations to make the character's movements look smoother and behave differently when jumping. Of course, in case the game doesn't end after the character walks out of the frame, I added an end condition.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to learn some basic things about Unity and add some basic elements to my game. After installing Unity and creating a new project, I dragged the sprites folder into the project which can be downloaded from the instruction I read. The great thing is Unity already had a gravity system, so I just add colliders(also called the hitbox) to all the elements. The instruction also provide some animations, so when I edited the animator interface and started the game, the whole game looked animate.
